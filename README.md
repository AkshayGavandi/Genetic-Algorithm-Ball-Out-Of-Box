Problem Statement and Approach

To develop the genetic algorithm for solving the classic ball out of a box Problem, where the main objective is to take the put out of a box to achieve which we have implemented 5 Classes: Ball class, Evolution class, Population class,Fitnesscalc class and Main class. Ball class mainly focus on defining the DNA, Population and evolution class focus on how the DNA was translated to current coordinates and the Crossover/ Mutate process. The Population class mainly contains the whole list of balls and maintains the current co-ordinates of the ball. Fitnesscalc class has methods to evaluate the fitness of each ball and selects the population for evolution. Main class stores the parameters for running the program.
